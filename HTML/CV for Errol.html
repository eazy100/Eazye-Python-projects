    <h1> Curriculum Vitae of Errol Andrews </h1>
    <p> My name is Errol Andrews, I grew up in Eldorado Park where I completed 
        my senior academic career at Willow Crescent Secondary School.
        After completing my matric I pursued a career in IT industry.
        Where I completed my web designing programme at Damln computer school.
        Later the same year I enrolled at EP computer school to learn the basics in computers.
        I then lanaded my 1st Job as call centre agent at standard bank, later moved
        to a new mobile company called 8ta (back then) as a call centre agent.
        I then moved to a new company called Telkom Mobile as a Technical support.
        My love for technology grew and I didnt know where to start. Later in 2015 I took on my career path
        with MANCOSA business scool where I completed my 3 year degree in Bachelor of Commerce in Information and Technology Management.
        After completing my degree I went deeper into the IT industry and started my career as technical support in the mobile industry
        under Telkom mobile, assisting internal and external customers with technical issues when porting numbers over to Telkom Mobile.
        As my journey continued I took my studies t o new hights by completing my postgraduate diploma in Project Management at MANCOSA business school.
        completing my 1 year diploma in project management in information technology.
        Due to the monotany of my previous profession I have developed a passion for 
        software development. The idea of becoming a software developer was motivated
        by the flexibility of the work life balance and the substantial financial 
        rewards. Learning about DevOps, testing or agile methodologies is what I would 
        most likely aspire to do.
        I recently completed my Python course with Udemy and I am currently enrolled with Udemy for my SQL course,
        and other python machine learning and linux shell scripting courses. I believe with this courses I will be able to
        develop my skills and knowledge in the IT industry as a software developer.
        currently i have a good understanding of shell scriping, bash scripting, python programming, SQL and database management.
        I completed a few projects with python testing my knowledge in python programming and database management.
